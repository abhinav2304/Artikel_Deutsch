# Artikel Deutsch - German Vocabulary Learner

Welcome to the **Interactive German Vocabulary Learner**! This project is designed to help you master over 1,400 German vocabulary items and internalize the tricky gender articles (der, die, das) through interactive tools and games.

## 🚀 How to Use the App

You don't need to install any special software, run a server, or know how to code to use this app. The entire application is packaged into a single, portable HTML file!

### Step 1: Open the App
1. Download or clone this repository to your computer.
2. Double-click on the **`german_learning_app.html`** file in the root directory. 
3. It will automatically open in your default web browser (like Chrome, Safari, or Edge) and you can start learning immediately!

You can also email this file to yourself, keep it on your phone, or share it with friends. It requires no internet connection to function!

### Step 2: Explore the Features

* **Dashboard**: See your total word count (over 1,400 words!) and track your progress.
* **Article Game**: A fast-paced game where you have 60 seconds to match the correct article (Der, Die, or Das) to the German noun. It uses color-coding to help build visual memory.
* **Smart Flashcards**: Review words at your own pace. Click a card to flip it and reveal the translation, article, and plural form. You can seamlessly filter the cards via cascading dropdowns by Lesson (Lektion 1-12) and their specific subcategories!
* **Categorized Vocabulary List**: A complete, searchable dictionary of all vocabulary in the database. Filter by Lesson, search in English or German, and view your vocabulary cleanly grouped by `der`, `die`, and `das`.
